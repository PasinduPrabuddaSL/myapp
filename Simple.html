    <p>Just as important in Java and in modern programming in general is the basic concept of
        asynchronous events. While programmers don’t actually deal with interrupts directly, they
        do often find themselves writing event handlers, which, like interrupt handlers, are called
        asynchronously when specified events occur. Such “event-driven programming” has a very
        different feel from the more traditional straight-through, synchronous programming. We will
        begin with the more traditional type of programming, which is still used for programming
        individual tasks, but we will return to threads and events later in the text.</p>
